Using on sky data from 2025 from LSSTCam, an analysis of astrometric residuals output is done. As expected, Astrometric residuals are dominated by atmospheric turbulences. Once the contribution of the turbulence is removed by modeling it with anisotropic Gaussian process, effect at the sensor level is compute to characterize static astrometric defect.
